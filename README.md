## Step 1: Begin with [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft)

![Cyfrin Updraft](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cacde350-d48c-4e13-b683-7f8d310cb7d5/6cd1ed65-3043-4151-b777-81949f597a24/image.png)

Cyfrin Updraft is a **free introductory course** designed specifically for those who are new to blockchain and smart contracts. Even if you’ve never written a line of code, this course breaks down complex ideas into **simple, digestible lessons**, covering:

- **Blockchain Fundamentals**
  - Gain a solid grasp of how Ethereum functions, how blocks are created, and why decentralization matters for security.
  
- **Solidity Basics**
  - Learn the syntax and structure of the programming language used for most Ethereum smart contracts—no previous coding experience required.
  
- **Common Vulnerabilities**
  - Dive into foundational security pitfalls like reentrancy attacks, oracle manipulation, and access control issues.
  
- **Security Mindset**
  - Understand how to think like an auditor, spotting potential exploits before they become real threats.

By the time you complete Cyfrin Updraft, you’ll have a clear understanding of **how smart contracts function** and an eye for **where the most common pitfalls** lie.

## Step 2: Get Your Hands Dirty with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) & Tooling

![Solidity & Tooling](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cacde350-d48c-4e13-b683-7f8d310cb7d5/1157459c-65ba-4848-8a57-8c89df03245d/image.png)

Now that you’ve seen the basics, it’s time to **experiment**. Building small projects and testing them locally helps cement your knowledge:

- **Practice Writing Simple Contracts**
  - Create a basic ERC20 token or a “Hello World” contract to learn about functions, state variables, and events.
  
- **Use the Right Tools**
  - Utilize frameworks like [**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to compile, test, and debug your smart contracts efficiently.
  
- [**Explore Our Blog**](https://threesigma.xyz/blog)
  - Stay updated with regular posts about smart contract security, current threats, and advanced techniques.
  
- **Study Real DeFi Projects**
  - Review code from robust protocols like [Maple](https://github.com/maple-labs) to observe their security patterns and spark ideas for your own audits.

## Step 3: [Owen Thurm’s Advanced Web3 Security Course (Parts 1 & 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRZogmD647U)

![Advanced Web3 Security Course](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cacde350-d48c-4e13-b683-7f8d310cb7d5/c9acec34-b0fe-4a84-a04d-12f2ad1b79d6/image.png)

This **two-part series** is designed to take learners from solid fundamentals to **expert-level** auditing skills. It focuses on both **practical demonstrations**—like live code walkthroughs—and **theoretical foundations** that explain why and how advanced exploits succeed (or fail).

### What You’ll Learn in Owen Thurm’s Courses

- **Under-the-Hood Contract Design**
  - Explore best practices for safe architecture, delve into **external call safety**, and tackle **reentrancy** in all its forms.
  
- **Testing Strategies & Advanced DeFi**
  - Discover systematic testing methods (including fuzzing) and deepen your understanding of **perpetuals** and other **high-level DeFi mechanisms**.
  
- **On-Chain Manipulation & Reporting**
  - Learn about **frontrunning** and **sandwich attacks**, and how to write **clear, compelling vulnerability reports**.
  
- **Code Deep Dives & EVM Mastery**
  - Participate in **live audit sessions** and explore EVM internals, covering **memory layouts**, **Yul optimizations**, and **calldata handling**.

This course pushes you to think like a determined adversary and **sharpen your investigative mindset** for high-stakes auditing.

## Step 4: Start Doing [CTFs](https://github.com/blockthreat/blocksec-ctfs)

![CTFs](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cacde350-d48c-4e13-b683-7f8d310cb7d5/55fe1f79-75b9-474d-9b30-d1f47dab5c1a/hqdefault.jpg)

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges are a fun, hands-on way to **test exploit techniques** and sharpen your auditing instincts:

- **Recommended CTFs**
  - [*Ethernaut*](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/): Puzzle-like challenges focusing on various smart contract vulnerabilities.
  - [*Damn Vulnerable DeFi*](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/): Emphasizes common DeFi exploits.

**Pro Tip:** It’s easy to get caught in an endless cycle of CTF practice. One or two challenges are great to build confidence and creativity, but **don’t let CTFs become a distraction** from real auditing experience. Your ultimate goal is to audit live protocols and uncover tangible vulnerabilities.
